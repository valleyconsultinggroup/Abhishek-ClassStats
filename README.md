# Berkeley Class Stats
Abhishek Bollapragada, Fall 2018 VCG Dev.

### Description

Currently, Berkeley students have don't have a good idea of what their grade in a class is during the semester. For example, if I did 0.4 SDs above the mean in a class midterm how do I know what that means. This application attempts to solve that problem. I will be scraping berkeley time data to calculate statistics that would be useful to student during the semester to give them a better idea about their grades. 

### Timeline
**TODO**: Create a table outlining what you're going to work on step by step.

| # | Description   | Hours Estimated | Completion Date | 
| - | ------------- | --------------- | --------------- | 
| 1 | Figure out where to scrape from the Berkeley Website | 1 Hours | N/A |
| 2 | Design a Python approach to obtain xhr reponses from the berkeleytime website and parse them | 2 Hours | N/A | 
| 3 | Find out how to generalize the code for any class as an input | 2 Hours | N/A |
| 4 | Extend this platform to helping students with class enrollment by adding features such as an option to input your address and find classes that are closer to you for a certain requirement like a breadth | 5 Hours | N/A |

### Technical Stack
**TODO**: Describe the languages, libraries, frameworks, and tools that went into your project. Make sure to add a brief description of its utility, unlike the list below.

* Python
* Requests ---> Allows interaction with berkeley time urls to fetch data
* JSON ---> Allows the parsing of JSON formatted files for ease of use
* Scipy ---> Will be helpful for statistics calculations
* Seleninum ---> An Automated Web Browser API that can be used for a wide range of functions

### Implementation
**TODO**: Complete this while you're working on your project. Preferably, you're describing what steps you took for different parts of the project.

* Finding the data: Visited the berkeleytime website and inspected the network traffic to see where berkeley time is pulling its data from

### Supplementary Material
**TODO**: Include any links to materials that might help people learn more about your project.
